CLASSNOTES & HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
CLASS - July 9, 2023 - SUNDAY - CLASS 11 @6:30 PM EST (INTERMEDIATE)

FOR LOOP
⁃	A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string, or a set of numbers).
⁃	A for loop is a special type of loop in python that allows us to loop over different collections of items.

# LAB 1 - APPLYING "FOR LOOP" TO A STRING

for letter in "Naruto Uzumaki":
    print(letter)

# LAB 2 - APPLY "FOR LOOP" TO A LIST

Animecharacters = ["Goku", "Vegeta", "Piccolo", "Chi Chi"]
for Anime in Animecharacters:
    print(Anime)

# LAB 3 - APPLY "FOR LOOP" TO A SERIES OF NUMBERS WITH THE RANGE FUNCTION

for index in range(21):
    print(index)

# LAB 4 - APPLYING "FOR LOOP" TO A SERIES OF A SPECIFIC RANGE OF NUMBERS

for index in range (10, 21):
    print(index)

FOR LOOP AND THE BREAK STATEMENT
⁃	The break statement can stop a loop before it has looped through all the elements

# LAB 5 - APPLYING "FOR LOOP" TO BREAK STATEMENTS

cars = ["Tesla", "BMW", "Mercedes", "Hummer"]
for x in cars: 
    print(x)
    if x == "BMW":
        break

FOR LOOP AND THE CONTINUE STATEMENT
⁃	The continue statement and stop or skip the current iteration of the loop, and then continue with the next 

# LAB 6 - APPLYING FOR LOOP TO CONTINUE STATEMENTS

laptops = ["Lenovo", "HP", "Mac", "Dell", "Toshiba"]
for y in laptops:
    if y == "HP":
        continue
    print(y)

# LAB 7 - APPLYING "FOR LOOP" TO ESLE STATEMENTS

animecharacters = ["Vegeta", "Goku", "Piccolo", "Chi Chi", "Yamcha"]
for x in animecharacters:
    print(x)
else:
    print("These are some of the characters in Dragon Ball Z")

# LAB 8 - APPLYING "FOR LOOP" TO THE END PARAMETER

animecharacters = ["Vegeta,", "Goku,", "Piccolo,", "Chi Chi,", "Yamcha"]
for anime in animecharacters:
    print(anime, end=" ")
