Today’s class with have 4 labs dealing with lists.

LISTS

- In work you’ll be dealing with large amounts of data. When dealing with this you want to make sure that you manage this data properly.
- A list is essentially just a structure you can use to store lists of information.

PRINTING OUT SPECIFIC ELEMENTS FROM YOUR LISTS:

- Each one of the elements in your lists have a particular numeric index.
- Standard numeric index in python start at 0 when it comes to lists.

BRACKETS [] ARE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH LISTS

# LAB 1 - CREATING OUR FIRST LIST

Anime = ["Naruto", "Shingeki No Kyojin", "Bleach", "Yu Yu Hakusho", "Dragonball Z"]
print(Anime)

# LAB 2 PRINTING OUT A SPECIFIC ELEMENT OR VALUE FROM THIS LIST

Cars = ["Tesla", "BWM", "Nissan GTR", "Ferrari", "Ford"]
print(Cars[4])

Favorite_Female_Actress = ["Stacy Dash", "Halle Berry", "Vivica Fox", "Nia Long", "Rosie Perez", "Eva Mendes"]
print(Favorite_Female_Actress[-4])

NOTE: [-NEGATIVE NUMBERS] WILL PRINT THE LIST FROM THE LEFT SIDE INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT SIDE.

# LAB 3 PRINTING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS FROM YOUR LIST

# LAB 4 - MODIFYING A VALUE IN YOUR LIST AND UPDATING IT
