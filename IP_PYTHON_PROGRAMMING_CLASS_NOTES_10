WHILE LOOP 
- A while loop will run a piece of code while a condition is true. It will keep executing the desired set of code statements until that condition is no longer true.
- It is a structure in python which allows you to loop through and execute a block of code multiple times.

# LAB 1 - OUR FIRST WHILE LOOP EXAMPLE

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1 

print("The Loop Ends Here!")

# LAB 2 - NEVER ENDING LOOP EXAMPLE

i = 1
while i <=10: 
    print(i)

print("The Loop Ends Here!")

# LAB 3 - WHILE LOOP WITH STATEMENTS

i = 1
while i<=5:
    print("Bleach")
    i = i + 1

INTRODUCTION TO F STRINGS
- F strings are used to format data that you want to add in. 
-  You must place the expression or value in the middle of strings.
- F-strings are string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly brackets containing expressions that will be replaced with their values

# LAB 4 - F STRING LAB

car = "Tesla"

print(f"The car I drive is {car}")

# LAB 5 - COMBINE WHILE WITH THE INPUT FUNCTION AND F STRING (COMPLEX)

Name = input("Enter Your Name To Begin The Game: ")

while Name == "":
    print("Player One Did Not Enter His Name")
    Name = input("Enter Your Name To Begin the Game: ")
print(f"Welcome! {Name}")

# LAB 6 - MORE COMPLEX WHILE LOOP CODE

age = int(input("Enter Your Age To Begin The Game: "))

while age < 0:
    print("Age Can't be Negative!")
    age = int(input("Enter Your Age To Begin The Game: "))

print(f"You are {age} years old!")

# LAB 7 - USING THE "NOT" OPERATOR WITH WHILE LOOPS

Anime = input("Enter an anime series that you like (press q to quit): ")

while not Anime == "q":
    print(f"You like {Anime}")
    Anime = input("Enter another anime series that you like (press q to quit): ")

print("Thanks for letting us know what anime shows you like!")

# LAB 8 - USING THE "OR" OPERATOR with WHILE LOOPS

num = int(input("Enter a Number Between 1 - 20: "))

while num < 1 or num > 20:
    print(f"{num} is not valid")
    num = int(input("Enter a Number Between 1 - 20: "))

print(f"Your Number is {num}")
