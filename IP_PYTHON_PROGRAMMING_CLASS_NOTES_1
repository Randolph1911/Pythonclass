PYTHON JOURNAL

Note: Python is case-sensitive and does not like capital characters.

STRING ATTRIBUTES:
\ - The backslash character and quotation “\” allows the line to have a quote within the string.
\n - Allows the code to space to the next line

#Lab 1 Strings. below are a bunch of strings that we have written within our first python file

ATTENTION TO DETAIL MATTERS - ATTENTION TO DETAIL MATTERS

#Lab 1 Strings. Below are a bunch of strings that we have written our first python class.

#This is an example of a normal string
print("Today is a new day")
print("My first string was created on 16 April 2023. I am so happy to have begun my python journey!")
print("I love being a passport bro")
print("I am conflicted between latino women and asian women")
print("in the last two weeks, I have found myself liking south korean women more")
print("I hope to one day meet a half brazillian, half japanese and quarter korean woman!")
print("I use to crush hard on vivica fox")

#This is an example of how to put quotations into a string
print("\"Bruh!\" Allen Iverson is the greatest basketball player ever!")
print("The best Brazilian movie of all time is ""\"City of God\".")

#This is an example of how to put a new line into a string
print("New\nline")
print("Lebron James is a better basketball player than \nMichael Jordan")

#Lab 2 Variables. This were the first variables we have written in the class

#This is an example of a variable
my_str = "Michael Jordan only won the NBA championship with one team. But Lebron won it with three!"
print(my_str)

my_str_another = "Allen Iverson may not have have won an NBA championship but he was technically better than MJ"
print(my_str_another)

blue = "This is what the sky looks like! "
print(blue)

blue_green_orange_purple = "These colors are terrible!"
print(blue_green_orange_purple)

#This is an example of how to use variables to deploy massive changes to a lot of code
character_name = "Anis Bryant"
character_age = "22"
character_job = "The CEO of Microsoft and Twitter"
character_country = "Japan"

print("There was a passport bro called " +character_name+ ",")
print("he is " +character_age+ " years old")
print("He works as " +character_job+ ".")
print("He got married to a beautiful half brazilian half japanese woman from " +character_country+ ".")

#Lab 3 Comments.

#This is example of a comment.  The hashtag at the beginning lets python know that we are working on a comment.
