CLASS - June 4, 2023 - SUNDAY - CLASS 6 @6PM EST

Today’s class was concerning using the TUPLE function. Tuples are IMMUTABLE (Please remember this)

TUPLES

- A Tuple is a type of data structure, which basically means that it’s a container where we can store different values, it is where we can store multiple pieces of information in a single variable. 
- Similar to lists but two key differences:
    - Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parenthesis () instead of square brackets [] for lists.
    - Tuples are immutable (meaning they cannot be changed or modified) and lists are mutable (meaning they can be changed).
    - If you need to modify your data, then the mutability you have with list is what you want
    - If you want a list of values that you know are not going to change then you should use a tuple.
    - Majority of the time you will use lists. Tuples are mostly used in a particular situations, e.g. numbers in your code that must not be changed.

# LAB 1 - CREATING OUR FIRST TUPLE

tuple = ("Tesla", "Bently", "Hummer", "Jeep", "Ferrari")
print(tuple)

anime = ("Naruto", "Bleach", "Dragon Ball", "Hunter X Hunter")
print(anime)

latops = ("HP", "Samsung", "Apple", "Sony")
print(latops)

numbers = (5,9,2,1,0)
print(numbers)

countries = ("Japan", "Spain", "Morocco", "Canada")
print(countries)

# LAB 2 - PRINTING A SINGLE VALUE FROM OUR TUPLE

tuple = ("Tesla", "Bently", "Ferrari", "Nissan", "BMW")
print(tuple[2])

# LAB 3 - EXAMPLE ON WHY TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE (MEANING THEY CANNOT BE CHANGED)

tuple = ("Tesla", "Bently", "Hummer", "Jeep", "Ferrari")
tuple[1] = "Nissan"
print(tuple[1])

ERROR MESSAGE:

line 4, in <module>
    tuple[1] = "Nissan"
    ~~~~~^^^
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

Note: If you receive the above error message, you have successfully demonstrated why tuples are immutable.

Common Interview question: “What’s the difference between a list and a tuple?”
